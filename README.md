# üß† Parkinson's Disease Prediction - Final ML & AI Project

This project is a complete machine learning pipeline and interactive web app that predicts the likelihood of Parkinson's disease based on vocal measurements.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `EDA_and_Modeling_Parkinsons_FINAL_GRIDSEARCH_SAVED.ipynb`  
  Full analysis notebook: EDA, preprocessing, model comparison, and model export.

- `app_styled_fixed.py`  
  Streamlit web application for real-time prediction with beautiful layout and visualization.

- `model.pkl`  
  Trained and optimized model saved with GridSearchCV using RandomForest + StandardScaler (Pipeline).

- `requirements.txt`  
  All Python packages required to run the app.

---

## üöÄ How to Run the App

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app_styled_fixed.py
   ```
